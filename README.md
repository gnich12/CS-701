Rich Internet Application Development @ BU MET MS CIS

This course we program interactive apps by studing html5 and the new features that like client storage, api, websockets also jquery mobile
etc. you can see different samples of what we learn from the six assignments i have uploaded. Noted that for some of them you need to put
them on your own local server to run i use XAMPP to run the projects. 

Also please forgive me i have to update some of them since the api keys doesnt work anymore, but feel free to take a look at them and leave 
comments or fork it.
